Hi, my name is Arjun Attam, and **Inter Alia** is my personal website. I'm interested in technology, internet businesses, and the principles of economics.

I'm working on:

- [Rubberduck](https://www.rubberduck.io): a browser extension to speed up code reviews
- [vscode-chat](https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat): VS Code extension to integrates chat in the editor for easier contextual collaboration
- [gitstats.report](https://gitstats.report): source control stats to track your engineering team momentum

I'm as [@arjunattam](https://twitter.com/arjunattam/) on Twitter and my DMs are open for conversations.
