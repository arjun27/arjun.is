Hello, world! My name is Arjun. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product manager at Microsoft, where I work on developer tools and services. With every company becoming a software company, I believe making developers productive creates a lot of value, and I enjoy working with them. Before joining Microsoft, I built [Rubberduck](https://www.rubberduck.io) and [Team Chat](https://github.com/karigari/vscode-chat) to explore how developers collaborate, and I'm now applying these learnings at scale.

On the side, I host [the Startup Green Room](https://startupgreenroom.com) podcast, to showcase the best operators in the Indian startup ecosystem. I've learnt and grown by building startups in India, and this podcast is my way to stay connected and contribute to the ecosystem.

If there's a way I can help, feel free to reach out. I'm available at arjun@attam.in, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arjunattam/) DMs.
