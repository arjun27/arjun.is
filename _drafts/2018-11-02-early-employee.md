# Heuristic for early employees

[Social Capital's Annual Letter 2018](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/socialcapital-annual-letters/Social+Capital+Interim+Annual+Letter,+2018.pdf) has an interesting section on how incentives in the startup ecosystem have evolved with increasing user acquisition cost. VCs prefer higher valuations, which enable them to raise larger funds, and consequently make more management fees (2% of fund size). This introduces hidden costs for two participants: LPs of these funds, and startup employees:

> The second group of people left holding the bag is far more tragic: the employees at startups. The trend in Silicon Valley today is for a large percentage of employee compensation to be given out in the form of stock options or restricted stock units. Although originally helpful as a way to incentivize and reward employees for working hard for an uncertain outcome, in a world where startup valuations are massively inflated, employees are granted stock options at similarly inflated strike prices.

I am sympathetic to the cause of the early employee: I believe it is a front row seat in creating value, with room to experiment across different functions. On the other hand, choosing to be an early employee at a early stage co is irrational, at least financially: the risk-adjusted upside will not make up for the opportunity cost: "professional-athelete level compensation packages"[^1] from Big Tech. Choosing an early employee gig for the potential up-skilling early in one's career is still overall rational choice, in my opinion.

For these candidates, it is relative easier to evaluate which sectors they like, and follow funding news to find credible startups. It is difficult to evaluate internal operations, which often determines the actual experience of an employee, and whether the metric of success (fast cross-function up-skilling) is achieved.

From the ~20 early stage startups that I have been able to see closely, I have determined two questions that early employee candidates must investigate before making a decision. My vantage point is India first, but I don't think that introduces any major bias.

## Relationship between co-founders

Co-founder conflict is fairly common, and an early employee can find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place when that happens. In more startups the co-founder relationship is not actually collaborative: co-founders challenge each other, handle disagreement with mutual respect. Getting to understand the co-founder relationship is critical, and you must have one-on-ones with co-founders. In those conversations, ask the following:

* When was the last disagreement with the other co-founders? Walk me through that situation.
* What is one thing you would do differently but have not been able to? What are the challenges that you ran into?

An unequal co-founder relationship is fairly common, with one dominate co-founder. This co-founder should have access to customers. For example, if the startup is building a SaaS tool for pharma R&D, the dominant co-founder needs to have deep connections in the industry. If the dominant co-founder does not own customer relationships, you have a red flag.

## Product development process

Finding product-market fit is difficult, but the science around it has matured over the last few years. [Customer development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_development) is a methodology to reduce risk in discovering product market fit, and jumping into a ship that does not follow that science is extremely risky and often leads to a lot of wasted time.

To evalute this, candidates must go over the product definition documents, and if possible, participate in a real product prioritisation discussion. In one-on-one conversations during interviews, ask the following:

* How many potential customers did you talk to before defining the MVP?
* What was a feature that was removed in the MVP definition?

Learnings from this process impact not just product management, and hence are critical for early employee up-skilling.
