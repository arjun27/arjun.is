Alokik and I got together to launch the Startup Green Room podcast a couple of months ago. Six episodes in, I know a thing or two about podcasting, and this post outlines those learnings.

## Basic idea

When I was doing research for Rubberduck, I would interview engineering managers and senior developers about how their teams collaborated. What was curious was how they were always very keen to hear how other teams functioned.

Similarly, Alokik's team as a founder made him realize how most of his learnings came from talking to other companies. There was no "knowledge bank" for how startups operate, especially for teams in India.

This knowledge is very operations focused: tactical advice that you can bring to your teams today.

Both of us owe a lot of our careers to the Indian startup ecosystem, and both of us are not working in it anymore. Given that, the podcast is a great way for us to stay connected to the ecosystem.
