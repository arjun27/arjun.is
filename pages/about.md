# About

My name is Arjun Attam, and this is my personal website. I'm interested in technology and economics, and this journal is an effort to cultivate my interest by writing.

I'm [@arjunattam](https://twitter.com/arjunattam/) on Twitter.

arjun.is is hosted by [Blot](https://blot.im/). If the theme (it's called Rosa on Blot) looks oddly familiar, it is (heavily) inspired by [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/). Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Also, credits to [tinygraphs](http://www.tinygraphs.com/#?name=arjun.is&shape=labs%2Fisogrids%2Fhexa&theme=seascape&numcolors=4#tryitout) for the icon.
